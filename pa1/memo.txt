2. SeparateChainingHashST time = 75ms
   LinearProbingHashST time  = 53ms
   SequentialSearchST time = 41188ms
   Ordered ST time = 98ms

3. Separate Chaining and Linear probing perform search 
and insert operation at constant time while Ordered ST 
performs it at logarithmic time. But SequentialSearch 
performs insert and search at linear time. Out of all 4,
as seen in times obtained from (2), Linear Probing is fastest
 and Separate Chaining is comparable to that followed by 
Ordered ST while Sequential Search takes a lot longer time.
