Question 1:

For this question, I implemented my code with quotation(“ “) around the name of the actors whose Bacon Number is to be found.

janwesh@itserver6:~/cs310/pa2/classes$ java -cp .:../lib/algs4.jar cs310.DegreesOfSeparationBFS movies.txt "/" "Bacon, Kevin"
Done reading movies.txt
"Kidman, Nicole"
Kidman, Nicole has a bacon number of 2
Kidman, Nicole was in Bewitched (2005) with Grier, David Alan
Grier, David Alan was in Woodsman, The (2004) with Bacon, Kevin

Question 2:
I used the recursive method recalc to recursively calculate all the spots.
Then I used groupnumber method that calculates all the groups of spots and
also prints all the spots from that group.


Question 3:

For the difference,it is quite clear that the path from 0 to 7 has changed in the two implementations as the weights including the edge were same but the modified Dijkstra takes the path with less number of edges.
